<h2>
  school
</h2>
<p>
  I’m in my second year at <a href="http://umbc.edu">University of Maryland, Baltimore County</a> majoring in Computer Science.
  I’m taking classes in artificial intelligence and robotics with hopes of bridging the gap between computers and their users.
<h2>
  work experience
</h2><p>
  I’ve been working as a software engineering intern at <a href="http://www.cougaarsoftware.com">Cougaar Software</a> since the summer of 2013.
  My projects have included building several robots that utilize distributed design principles,
  as well as writing hardware-based libraries to help Java task <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino microcontrollers</a>.
</p>
<h2>
  what's next?
</h2><p>
  I want a position that gives me the opportunity to experience the different fields that computer science has to offer.
  I’m especially interested in working with companies involved in robotics, high frequency trading, and big data.
</p><p>
  In my own time, I want to learn more web programming, Swift, and
  the seemingly infinite <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">list of Mac keyboard shortcuts</a>.
</p>
<h2>
  other interests
</h2>
<p>When I'm not on a computer, I like to play cards; mostly hearts, spades, and euchre; and listen to music,
  especially concept albums like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq1UqWidVoSWs8B0HWcfGl6bXiIl0XJp3">Tallahassee by The Mountain Goats</a>. Oh, and I like reading dystopian novels
  like The Giver, Nineteen Eighty-Four, and, my favorite, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_(novel)">We</a>.
</p>

  real time artificial intelligence
</h2><p>
  Starting recently, I built a simple two dimensional shooting game. The player can move up and down as
  well as shoot and shield. The objective of this project is to practice implementing a small scale version of a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/15k3f4/how_does_ai_work_in_video_games/">real time video game AI</a>. Currently, the AI consists of a state
  detection mechanism with several pre-programmed maneuvers to switch contextually based on the situation.

<p>
  I plan on expanding this project into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural networks</a> in the near future.

<h2>
  decision tree
</h2>
<p>
  A few years ago, I was taking a self-led class. Over the course of the year, I was to
  develop one application that I was proud of to present to the class.
  The result was a computer that plays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect Four</a>. Using a data structure that I
  based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax theorem</a>, the computer could look a certain number (user defined)
  of moves into the future. Using its knowledge of the future, it determined the best
   move by deciding which move is most likely to lead to the desired board position.
   When deciding, it takes into account the best moves for itself, as well as the best
    moves for its opponent. The end result is a computer that's pretty hard to beat!</p>

<h2>robotics</h2>
<p>
I was one of the founding members of
UMBC’s robotics club, <a href="http://my.umbc.edu/groups/retrieverrobotics">Retriever Robotics</a>. I have been one of the principle programmers since the club's inception and was also the treasurer for the 2014-2015 academic year,
which was an experience.</p>
<p>
 We work on competition robots for VEX U. In the video
below, you can see our robots in blue beating the College of Southern Maryland in a <a href="http://www.VEXrobotics.com/wiki/Toss_Up"> VEX Toss Up</a> match
last year. The robot I spent the most time working on is the one that ends up doing the
pull-up near the end.

<h2>
  boggle
</h2><p>
  I made the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">boggle</a> in java as a way to experiment with different data structures.
  After trying multiple different ways of storing the dictionary to check the words against,
   I decided to go with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a>. This trie ended up being perfect because I ended up using
   it in an algorithm to find all of the words on a given boggle board. Starting at any
   of the letters on the board, the algorithm looks at the adjacent tiles and sees if
   any of those can help it form a word, and it can tell if it forms a word based on
   whether or not those two letters in sequence have any children in the trie.
   As a part of a group project in the spring of 2014, my boggle game was turned into an android app.
   <img src="images/img_1.png" alt="" align="center"/>
   My work on the project was mostly the art and the back-end of the app.
 </p><p>Here's the video we turned to demonstrate the game:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUAp8G69o78" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I also took it upon myself to try to figure out how many words were on a given 5x5 boggle board.
  To do that, there has to be an algorithm that looks at each tile and recursively develops a list of strings that could be made starting at that tile.
  To do this efficiently, I added a method to the trie that checks if a given string is a stem for any words. If and only if the given string has the
  possibility of making a word does the algorithm continue to run.
Because of this optimization, I run it and it instantly spits out the result:
  <pre>
  <code>
    word count:336
    score:592
    Longest Word: RESIDERS
  </code>
</pre>
