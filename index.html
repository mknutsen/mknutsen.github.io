                    As a final project for my AI class, I worked with a small team on implementing the classic board
                    game checkers in Java with Swing and developing an AI to play against. To pick the ideal move, an
                    implementation of the minimax theorm was used to algorithmically minimize the worst case scenario.
                    To allow the computer to manage the huge number of available moves, the alpha beta pruning technique
                    was added. This technique prevents the computer from exploring movement options that will never be
                    considered because the optimal move has already been discovered. Download the game <a

                        Starting recently, I built a simple two dimensional shooting game. The player can move up and
                        down
                        as
                        well as shoot and shield. The objective of this project is to practice implementing a small

                        time video game AI</a>. Currently, the AI consists of a state
                        detection mechanism with several pre-programmed maneuvers to switch contextually based on the
                        situation.

                    <p>
                        A few years ago, I was taking a self-led class. Over the course of the year, I was to
                        develop one application that I was proud of to present to the class.
                        The result was a computer that plays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect
                        Four</a>. Using a data structure that I
                        based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax theorem</a>, the computer
                        could
                        look a certain number (user defined)
                        of moves into the future. Using its knowledge of the future, it determined the best
                        move by deciding which move is most likely to lead to the desired board position.
                        When deciding, it takes into account the best moves for itself, as well as the best
                        moves for its opponent. The end result is a computer that's pretty hard to beat!</p>

                        I was one of the founding members of

                    <p>
                        I made the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">boggle</a> in java as a way to
                        experiment
                        with different data structures.
                        After trying multiple different ways of storing the dictionary to check the words against,
                        I decided to go with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> because it seemed to
                        preform
                        at least as fast as a hashtable with a significantly smaller memory footprint. Try it out <a
                            href="images/BoggleMaxKnutsen.jar">here</a>. </p>

                    <p>
                        As a part of a group project in the spring of 2014, my boggle game was turned into an Android
                        app.
                        <img src="images/img_1.png" alt="" align="center"/>
                        My work on the project was mostly the art and the back-end of the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here's the video we turned to demonstrate the game, which you can also <a href="images/Bog.apk">download</a>
                        (if you have an Android phone):</p>

                    <iframe width="652" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUAp8G69o78" frameborder="0"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>I also took it upon myself to try to figure out how many words were on a given 5x5 boggle board.
                        To do that, there has to be an algorithm that looks at each tile and recursively develops a list
                        of
                        strings that could be made starting at that tile.
                        To do this efficiently, I added a method to the trie that checks if a given string is a stem for
                        any
                        words. If and only if the given string has the
                        possibility of making a word does the algorithm continue to run.
                        Because of this optimization, I run it and it instantly spits out the result:
  <pre>
  <code>
      word count:336
      score:592
      Longest Word: RESIDERS
