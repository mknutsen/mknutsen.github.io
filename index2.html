            <h2>I <font color="#CC3300">♥️ </font>distrubuted systems.</h2>
<p>
            I spent the summer interning on Facebook's BLOB storage team implementing various optamizations to their
            existing workflow.<br>
            There was a cool class at UMBC that had me develop a distributed system using Hadoop and cutting edge
            Hadoop ecosystem components. Kafka was used to move data along the pipeline, pig was used to modify and
            repackage it, and then it was stored in HDFS and Accumulo. We also used Storm to experiment with
            streaming topologies.
            </p>
            <h2>I <font color="#CC3300">love </font>designing frameworks.</h2>

            <p>At Cougaar Software, I was tasked with designing a modular robotics framework based on the subsumption
                architecture. This mean that individual pieces of the system could take instructions more as suggestions
                and do what was best for them, while the planning system could recognize the different components that
                were available and use that to make the best decision.
                I’ve been working on a little framework that makes it easy to rapidly prototype Swing GUIs. It started
                out as the class or two i would always cut and paste to make a frame switch between panels and grew into
                a system that includes bits and pieces to help everything from animation to geometry while still
                remaining modular and concise.
            </p>

            <h2>I <font color="#CC3300">love</font> artificial intelligence and optimization.</h2>

            <p>I think game theory is really cool so I’ve used it to make computers that can play Connect Four and
                Checkers. The Connect Four bot was the year-long project for a high school class and it could
                successfully use the minimax theorem pose a good challenge against human players. In college, I decided
                to take it a step further, so I added alpha-beta pruning and applied this to a checkers game.
                I worked on making a drone that could help drowning people. Before the robot sustained water damage, it
                used computer vision to plan routes between the drones current location and the location of an orange
                item in a pool.
                The robot I made for Cougaar Software had planning technologies built in because of the goal-oriented
                architecture. It also used A* to complete movement-based directives.
                I used a trie to find all the words on a boggle board without looking at every possible combinations of
                paths.
